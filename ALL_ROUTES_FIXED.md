# All Route Names Fixed - October 23, 2025

## ✅ Complete Fix Applied

### Problem:
Multiple files were using `route('reservations.track')` which was incorrect.

### Root Cause:
Routes are in a Laravel route group with the prefix `users.` so the correct route name includes that prefix:
```
Correct:   route('users.reservations.track')  ✅
Incorrect: route('reservations.track')        ❌
```

### Files Fixed:

| File | Issue | Fixed |
|------|-------|-------|
| `resources/views/layouts/partials/home-navigation-clean.blade.php` | Cart icon link | ✅ |
| `resources/views/users/myOrders/trackReservations.blade.php` | Status filter cards + form action | ✅ |
| `resources/views/users/dashboard/index.blade.php` | Dashboard tracking card | ✅ |

### Total Changes:
- **Files Modified:** 3
- **Route References Fixed:** 6
- **Verification:** No more incorrect route references
