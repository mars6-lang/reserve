---

## 📝 Technical Changes

### File 1: `resources/views/users/prodsDetails/index.blade.php`
```php
// OLD (Line 193)
whereIn('status', ['received', 'completed'])  ❌

// NEW (Line 193)
where('status', 'received')  ✅
```

**Added:**
- Check for existing review
- Show message if already reviewed
- Logic: `$canReview = $hasReceivedOrder && !$hasExistingReview`

### File 2: `app/Http/Controllers/Users/reviewCommentsController.php`
```php
// OLD (Line 31)
whereIn('status', ['received', 'completed'])  ❌

// NEW (Line 31)
where('status', 'received')  ✅
```

**Updated Error Message:**
```
Old: "after receiving the reserved product"
New: "while the product is in RECEIVED status"
```

## 🔒 Protection Layers

### Layer 1: Frontend (View)
- Review form only shows when status = RECEIVED
- Already reviewed message shown when applicable
- UX is clear and intuitive

### Layer 2: Backend (Controller)
- Checks existing review first (prevents duplicates)
- Checks status = RECEIVED (prevents wrong status)
- Returns specific error messages
- Cannot be bypassed even with direct API calls

### Layer 3: Database
- `reviewcomments` table tracks each review
- One review per user per product combination
