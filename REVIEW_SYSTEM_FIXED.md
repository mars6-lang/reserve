# Review System - Fixed October 23, 2025

## ✅ What Was Fixed

### Problem:
- Users could review a product even after completing the order
- Users could review multiple times for the same product
- "Completed" status incorrectly allowed reviews

### Solution Applied:

Changed review logic from:
```php
// OLD - WRONG
whereIn('status', ['received', 'completed'])  ❌
// This allowed reviewing even after completion
```

To:
```php
// NEW - CORRECT
where('status', 'received')  ✅
// Only allows review while order is RECEIVED
```
